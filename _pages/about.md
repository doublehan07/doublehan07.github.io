I am a research assistant at [IIIS, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/index.html).

I was a Co-Founder of [Dexta Robotics Inc.](https://www.dextarobotics.com/)

I obtained my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University, with a solid background in **Electronic Engineering** and **Mechanical Engineering**.

I led [Team Tinker](https://tinkerfuroc.github.io/) (in the RoboCup @Home Open Platform competition).

My research interest lies in **robotics**: design & manufacture new robots, robot learning and manipulation.

**I am seeking a PhD position starting in Fall 2025.**
