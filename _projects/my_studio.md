<strong>I love building new hardware, robots, or apps. `Cool ideas are always welcome! Just comment below.ðŸ‘‡`</strong>

Since 2020, I have built my own studio in my dormitory. It contains almost everything I need to build a robot.

        <div class="caption">

For tools and devices, I have soldering irons, oscilloscopes, wave generators, DC power supplies, logic analyzers, Lego Bricks (Mindstorms), drills and wrenches, pliers, and screwdrivers...

I also have hundreds of types of screws, nuts, resistors, capacitors, and common electronic components.

Additionally, I have numerous boards like the Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi, STM32, ESP32, etc., as well as modules such as the IMU, nRF24L01, candleLight, Leap Motion, RealSense, Dynamixel Servos...

And of course, there are <strong>three 3D printers</strong>, a pocket <strong>CNC</strong>, a tabletop <strong>SMT</strong> machine, and two fire extinguishers!

I recently purchased a brand-new <strong>Bambu P1SC 3D printer</strong> for my studio, and I couldnâ€™t be happier with it! Itâ€™s smart, incredibly fast, and highly reliable with a low failure rate. `If youâ€™re in the market for a 3D printer, I highly recommend the Bambu P1SC for personal projects and the Bambu X1CC for lab or commercial use!`

I upgraded my Snapmaker with a dual extrusion module in March 2024, so now it can print with two materials (like PLA and Nylon) at the same time.

However, it's really time-consuming to use UG to design the tool path and set the spindle speed for a workpiece. That's why I rarely use the pocket CNC machine at home. (But I love staying at my friend's factory, using the huge commercial CNC Machine!)
