<strong>I love building new hardware, robots, or apps. `Cool ideas are always welcome! Just comment below.ðŸ‘‡`</strong>

Since 2020, I have built my own studio in my dormitory. It contains almost everything I need to build a robot.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/project/my_studio/studio1.jpg" title="My studio" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
        <div class="caption">
            My studio at a glance.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

For tools and devices, I have soldering irons, oscilloscopes, wave generators, DC power supplies, logic analyzers, Lego Bricks (Mindstorms), drills and wrenches, pliers, and screwdrivers...

I also have hundreds of types of screws, nuts, resistors, capacitors, and common electronic components.

Additionally, I have numerous boards like the Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi, STM32, ESP32, etc., as well as modules such as the IMU, nRF24L01, candleLight, Leap Motion, RealSense, Dynamixel Servos...

And of course, there are two 3D printers, a pocket CNC, a tabletop SMT machine, and two fire extinguishers!

I upgraded my Snapmaker with a dual extrusion module recently, so it can print using two materials (e.g., PLA + Nylon) simultaneously.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/project/my_studio/dual.jpg" title="Dual Extrusion 3D Printing Module" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
        <div class="caption">

    </div>

However, it's really time-consuming to use UG to design the tool path and set the spindle speed for a workpiece. That's why I rarely use the pocket CNC machine at home. (But I love staying at my friend's factory, using the huge commercial CNC Machine!)
